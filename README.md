# **Project**

This project show the performance a Machine Learning Model. It includes a test, training and predictions of a Machine Learning Model.

### **Data**  

Data is generated using python package as shown in src folder. it is found in ./data folder.

### **Analysis and summary Report**

Exploratory analysis is made to check the data using scatter plot. And the data is split into training and test. And logistic regression is used to train model. 

It is shown in [Analysis](https://github.com/TizuMussa/project/blob/main/reports/Report.ipynb)

The data and model predictions are shown:
